# Hello, my name is Aadam

## About Me:
### Software Engineer with Full-Stack Development Experience, fluent in the usage of JavaScript (MERN stack, Angular.js, Material_UI), Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn), and C++.

I am a Senior at the University of California, Davis, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with an expected graduation in December 2024. My passion for technology and its potential to transform the world has driven my academic and professional journey. I am particularly interested in full-stack application development, machine learning, and cloud-based solutions. In my most recent role as a Full-Stack Application Development Engineer Intern at Centene, I led a cross-functional team to modernize internal processes by developing a web application using Angular.js and Node.js. Additionally, I implemented serverless document processing using AWS Lambda, optimizing workflow and reducing intake delays. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on various impactful projects. For instance, Riskquipo, a HackDavis 2022 entry, aimed to help predict pregnancy complications using biometric data and artificial intelligence. In another personal project, Pomotimer, I created a modular, customizable timer to improve productivity using the Pomodoro technique. My skills span across programming languages (C/C++, Python, JavaScript, Swift), frameworks (React, Angular, Node.js), and cloud technologies (AWS). I am always eager to expand my expertise and collaborate on projects that use technology to improve lives. Let's connect and build something amazing!

## Projects 
- June 2021 - Present : Research Intern @UC Davis under [Karen Moxon](https://bme.ucdavis.edu/people/karen-moxon).  
  - Wrote programs in python that conducted dimensionality reduction on multi-featured datasets (via machine learning algorithms) 
  - Conducted linear discriminant analysis on a collection of data totaling over thousands of entries derived from rat kinematics with resultant programs 

- April 2022: [Riskquipo](https://github.com/mirzaaadam/Riskquipo-HackDavis2022-) (Hackdavis 2022 Submission, JavaScript + HTML + CSS)
  - Scripted Frontend web page for Machine Learning project using Gaussian Naive Bayes model to predict risk of mother/child mortality during pregnancy using biometric risk factors. 

- September 2022: [Pomotimer](https://github.com/mirzaaadam/Pomotimer) (C++)
  - Implemented the ‘Pomodoro’ method of study through the creation of an open-source two-stage timer wherein user defines length of cyclical rest and work periods through simple command line input.      


- October 2022-Present: Hooli (Swift + SwiftUI)
  - Implemented avatar creation and accompanying user interface, allowing for the assembling and encoding of user-customizable profile images stored and parsed throughout scheduling app. App in question, Hooli, is to be launched on the app store by March 2023.
