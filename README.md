### Software engineer versed in C, C++, and Python, and building familiarity with frontend languages like CSS, JS, and HTML through projects professional and personal.


- Hello, my name is Aadam Mirza, a current 2nd year Computer Science major at the University of California, Davis. My infatuation with technology has been a driving force in my career and life choices ever since I was a child. The sheer versatility of computational systems continue to amaze and inspire me, which is why I seek to utilize my growing expertise in software to improve the world around me. This is evident in almost all of my personal projects, such as [Riskquipo], which was my group's entry to the Hackdavis 2022 hackathon. Along with providing me with a pathway into frontend design a la HTML/CSS and JavaScript, Riskquipo utilized an artificial intelligence model to predict the risk of pregnancy complications based on various biometric factors, which would prove invaluable to those without easy access to medical facilities.
